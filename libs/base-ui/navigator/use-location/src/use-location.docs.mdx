import { useLocation } from './use-location';
import { useHref } from './use-href';

Provides the current location according to the current routing system.  
Defaults to `window.location`.

```tsx live
() => {
  const location = useLocation();

  return <div>current domain </div>;
};
```

## useHref()

Generate (string) path based on the contextual logic of the routing system. This is mostly relevant when making href for non-links elements, like iframes.  

> useHref will transform the location, as needed. For example, react router might include a basename.

```tsx live
() => {
  const href = useHref({
    pathname: '/some/path',
    search: 'what=isIt',
    hash: '29632d',
  });

  return <div>"{href}"</div>;
};
```
