import { Link } from './link';
import { NavLink } from './nav-link';

A standard link with an important beneifit:  
It gets its underlying implementation from context, so it can work in any component and any application.

Simply use it like you would use an `<a>` tag.
The link will get the implementation from context, or default to a regular `<a>` tag:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    // this always works
    <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link>
  );
}
```

In our projects, we've found that _links_ are much more common than routes, and at much lower levels.
**Using a single link in a large page forced all of it to use a specific routing system** (in our legacy site, it was `react-router: ^3.0.1`),
or use a native link, or get links by as props. None of these were good options.
That's why we chose to inject the link from context, which allowed our link to move between projects with ease, and plug into the existing routing mechanism.

You can easily provide a _Routing Adapter_, like so:

```tsx
import { Link } from '@watheia/base-ui.navigator.link';
import { RouterContextProvider } from '@watheia/base-ui.navigator.router-context';

const routingSystem = { Link };

function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Awesome page</h1>

      {/* this link will render ReactRouter link */}
      <RouterContextProvider value={ReactRouterSystem}>
        <Link href="/account">account</Link>
      </RouterContextProvider>

      {/* this link will render Wouter link */}
      <RouterContextProvider value={wouterRoutingSystem}>
        <Link href="/account">account</Link>
      </RouterContextProvider>

      {/* this link will default to a NativeLink */}
      <Link href="/legals">legals</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## NavLink

Like ReactRouter, we provide a `NavLink` component. It is a regular link, that also applies the provided styles when the `href` prop matches the current url. For example:

```tsx live
<>
  <div>
    current path:
    <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>
      "{typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.pathname}"
    </span>
  </div>
  <br />
  (active links should be orange)
  <br />
  local link:{' '}
  <NavLink
    href={typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.pathname}
    activeStyle={{ color: 'darkorange' }}
  >
    {typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.pathname : '?'}
  </NavLink>
  <br />
  other link:{' '}
  <NavLink href="/some/site/" activeStyle={{ color: 'darkorange' }}>
    /some/site/
  </NavLink>
</>
```

## Additional props:

These non-standard props allow extra funcitonality:

- `external` - open the link in a new tab (uses a native link).
- `native` - don't use the routing system, and just render a regular link.
- `state` - includes History state in the link, compatible with the native [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) api.  
  This needs to be supported by the routing sytem, and currently ignored in the native implementation.

`NavLink` also has the following props:

- `activeClassName`, `activeStyles` - styles to apply when href matches the current location.
- `active` - explicitly apply active styles. (leave `undefined` for automatic value).
- `exact` - match url exactly, and don't include subpaths.
- `strict` - include trailing slash when matching location.
